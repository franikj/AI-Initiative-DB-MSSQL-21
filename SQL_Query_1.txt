As a DB engineer I need to write a SQL query to retrieve top 10 best-selling products by revenue, with their corresponding sales revenue and quantity, for each quarter and year:
The query should return a data set which consists of following columns: [ProductName], [SalesQuantity], [SalesRevenue], [Quarter], [Year]

Tables: 

SELECT TOP (1000) [Stock Item Key]
      ,[WWI Stock Item ID]
      ,[Stock Item]
      ,[Color]
      ,[Selling Package]
      ,[Buying Package]
      ,[Brand]
      ,[Size]
      ,[Lead Time Days]
      ,[Quantity Per Outer]
      ,[Is Chiller Stock]
      ,[Barcode]
      ,[Tax Rate]
      ,[Unit Price]
      ,[Recommended Retail Price]
      ,[Typical Weight Per Unit]
      ,[Photo]
      ,[Valid From]
      ,[Valid To]
      ,[Lineage Key]
  FROM [Dimension].[Stock Item]

SELECT TOP (1000) [Order Key]
      ,[City Key]
      ,[Customer Key]
      ,[Stock Item Key]
      ,[Order Date Key]

      ,[Picker Key]
      ,[WWI Order ID]
      ,[WWI Backorder ID]
      ,[Description]
      ,[Package]
      ,[Quantity]
      ,[Unit Price]
      ,[Tax Rate]
      ,[Total Excluding Tax]
      ,[Tax Amount]
      ,[Total Including Tax]
      ,[Lineage Key]
  FROM [Fact].[Order]

SELECT TOP (1000) [Date]
      ,[Day Number]
      ,[Day]
      ,[Month]
      ,[Short Month]
      ,[Calendar Month Number]
      ,[Calendar Month Label]

      ,[Calendar Year Label]
      ,[Fiscal Month Number]
      ,[Fiscal Month Label]
      ,[Fiscal Year]
      ,[Fiscal Year Label]
      ,[ISO Week Number]
  FROM [Dimension].[Date]

Given the provided tables, you can determine the best-selling products by revenue using a combination of JOIN operations to combine the product, order, and date details.

The revenue for a product can be calculated by multiplying the quantity sold (Quantity column from Fact.Order table) by the unit price (Unit Price column from Fact.Order table).

To segregate the data by quarters, you can use the CASE statement.

Here's a query that should work:

sql
Copy code
WITH QuarterlySales AS (
    SELECT 
        si.[Stock Item] AS ProductName,
        SUM(o.[Quantity]) AS SalesQuantity,
        SUM(o.[Quantity] * o.[Unit Price]) AS SalesRevenue,
        CASE 
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (1,2,3) THEN 1
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (4,5,6) THEN 2
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (7,8,9) THEN 3
            ELSE 4
        END AS Quarter,
        d.[Calendar Year] AS Year
    FROM [Fact].[Order] o
    JOIN [Dimension].[Stock Item] si ON o.[Stock Item Key] = si.[Stock Item Key]
    JOIN [Dimension].[Date] d ON o.[Order Date Key] = d.[Day Number]
    GROUP BY si.[Stock Item], 
        CASE 
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (1,2,3) THEN 1
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (4,5,6) THEN 2
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (7,8,9) THEN 3
            ELSE 4
        END,
        d.[Calendar Year]
)

SELECT 
    ProductName,
    SalesQuantity,
    SalesRevenue,
    Quarter,
    Year
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ProductName, 
        SalesQuantity, 
        SalesRevenue, 
        Quarter, 
        Year,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Quarter, Year ORDER BY SalesRevenue DESC) AS rn
    FROM QuarterlySales
) AS RankedSales
WHERE rn <= 10
ORDER BY Year, Quarter, rn;
This query has a couple of parts:

In the QuarterlySales CTE (Common Table Expression), we aggregate the sales data for each product by quarter and year.
In the main query, we use ROW_NUMBER() to rank the products by their sales revenue within each quarter and year.
Finally, the WHERE clause filters to only include the top 10 products by revenue for each quarter and year.

i've got this error 
Msg 206, Level 16, State 2, Line 1
Operand type clash: date is incompatible with int
ChatGPT
Ah, the error suggests that there's a type mismatch when trying to JOIN on the [Order Date Key] from the [Fact].[Order] table and the [Day Number] from the [Dimension].[Date] table. This usually means one of them is a date type while the other is an int.

To resolve this, we need to first understand the nature of the columns [Order Date Key] and [Day Number]. If [Order Date Key] is an integer that represents the day (in a sequence or format like YYYYMMDD) and [Day Number] is similarly an integer, they can be directly joined.

However, if [Order Date Key] is a date datatype, then we need to convert it to a format that matches the [Day Number].

Let's assume [Order Date Key] is a date datatype and [Day Number] is an integer in the format YYYYMMDD. Here's how you'd adjust the query:

Convert [Order Date Key] to an integer format YYYYMMDD during the JOIN.
Here's the modified JOIN condition:

sql
Copy code
JOIN [Dimension].[Date] d ON CONVERT(INT, CONVERT(VARCHAR, o.[Order Date Key], 112)) = d.[Day Number]
Incorporate this into the earlier provided query, and the JOIN condition becomes:

sql
Copy code
FROM [Fact].[Order] o
JOIN [Dimension].[Stock Item] si ON o.[Stock Item Key] = si.[Stock Item Key]
JOIN [Dimension].[Date] d ON CONVERT(INT, CONVERT(VARCHAR, o.[Order Date Key], 112)) = d.[Day Number]
Use this adjusted JOIN condition and the rest of the query should work without this type mismatch error.




User
o.[Order Date Key]=d.Date you need to join by this fields, these two fields has type date 
ChatGPT
Understood. Let's modify the query accordingly. Given that both o.[Order Date Key] and d.Date are of date type, we can use a direct JOIN on these fields.

Here's the adjusted SQL:

sql
Copy code
WITH QuarterlySales AS (
    SELECT 
        si.[Stock Item] AS ProductName,
        SUM(o.[Quantity]) AS SalesQuantity,
        SUM(o.[Quantity] * o.[Unit Price]) AS SalesRevenue,
        CASE 
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (1,2,3) THEN 1
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (4,5,6) THEN 2
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (7,8,9) THEN 3
            ELSE 4
        END AS Quarter,
        d.[Calendar Year] AS Year
    FROM [Fact].[Order] o
    JOIN [Dimension].[Stock Item] si ON o.[Stock Item Key] = si.[Stock Item Key]
    JOIN [Dimension].[Date] d ON o.[Order Date Key] = d.[Date]
    GROUP BY si.[Stock Item], 
        CASE 
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (1,2,3) THEN 1
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (4,5,6) THEN 2
            WHEN d.[Calendar Month Number] IN (7,8,9) THEN 3
            ELSE 4
        END,
        d.[Calendar Year]
)

SELECT 
    ProductName,
    SalesQuantity,
    SalesRevenue,
    Quarter,
    Year
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ProductName, 
        SalesQuantity, 
        SalesRevenue, 
        Quarter, 
        Year,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Quarter, Year ORDER BY SalesRevenue DESC) AS rn
    FROM QuarterlySales
) AS RankedSales
WHERE rn <= 10
ORDER BY Year, Quarter, rn;
This corrected query joins the tables using the o.[Order Date Key] and d.Date columns directly, as per your guidance.
